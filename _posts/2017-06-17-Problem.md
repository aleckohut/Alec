Hillary Clinton won Virginia in 2016, Barack Obama won Virginia, twice;

We have a Democratic Governor, Lt. Governor, and Attorney General;

Hillary Clinton won 51 of Virginia’s 100 House Assembly districts, yet, 17 of which are held by a Republican;

Of the 49 districts Trump won, Democrats hold zero;

Our Assembly is controlled by Republicans 66 to 34;

VIRGINIA…WE HAVE A PROBLEM

It’s obviously not a messaging problem, when we get our message out, we win.

So, what is the problem? The problem is two-fold, 1) in non-Presidential elections, Republicans vote in higher numbers than Democrats.  2) Far too many people vote Democratic at the top of the ticket, then vote Republican in the state legislative races.

I can’t say why our message is not filtering down ballot, but perhaps it’s the same reason we’re not voting in higher propensity in off-year elections. We’re not reaching out.

Campaigns don’t reach out to these voters, because their efforts are, and should be concentrated on reaching voters more likely to vote, so these potential voters remain unreached. Which is where Turnout Blue – Virginia comes in.

With a horrible, and unpopular President, the time is now to reach out to these voters, and get them to the polls. When knocking on doors, I often hear that people are completely unaware of the elections being held in Virginia this year. The problem is not our message, the problem is not enough people hearing it.

With this in mind, Turnout Blue – Virginia has identified precincts in targeted assembly districts in Virginia, where Democrats gain a huge advantage when turnout increases.  In Fairfax County alone there are dozens of precincts, in targeted districts, where the additional votes in Presidential years favored the Democrats by an 80% or greater margin.

At Turnout Blue – Virginia, we will target these occasional voters, and get our message to them at least six times in the 10 days before Election Day, using mail, canvassing, and phone banks.  

The only real question will be how many voters can we reach, which depends on the amount of money we can raise. 

You can help by making a contribution to our efforts to get these voters to the polls, and use the 2017 Election in Virginia to send Donald Trump a message!!!
