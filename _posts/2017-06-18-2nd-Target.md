#1 -Turnout Blue - Virginia Flipable Seat

2nd House District -The Yo-Yo District

This was a new district, created in 2011 with parts of the old 28th, 52nd, and 88th districts.

Since then, it has switch parties, or yo-yo'd back and forth in every House of Delgates election.

We won this seat in 2013, by beating incumbent Mark Dudenhefer, who won the seat back in 2015, when Dudenfefer won by only 125 votes, despite outspending Democrat Josh King $452,000 to $181,000. 

In what could be considered an upset, Jennifer Carroll Foy beat 2015 nominee Josh King.

Trump underperformed in the 2nd vs. Romney, gaining only 39% of the vote. We cannot believe Trump will any more popular in November.

Not only should we win this one, but make it a safe Blue district.

Turnout Blue has identified six Target Precincts, where Democrats gain over 80% of the vote of occasional voters. There are approximately 3,200 occasional voters in those six precincts.
